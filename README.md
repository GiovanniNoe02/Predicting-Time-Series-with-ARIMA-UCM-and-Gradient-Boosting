Operational Guide for Reproducibility – Predicting Time Series with ARIMA, UCM and Gradient Boosting – Time Series Anlaysis Course

This project compares different forcasting models to predict values of a time series representing pedestrian traffic.

The project folder is organized into the following content:

- student_dataset.csv the data
- TSA_Project.Rmd the R Markdown file containing the code
- Predicting Time Series with ARIMA, UCM and Gradient Boosting.pdf the report of the project
- Time Series Project Presentation.pdf the project presentation

After the data are downloaded and souce directories are correclty selected, the code can be run to reproduce the results of this work.
